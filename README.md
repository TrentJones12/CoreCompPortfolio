# CoreCompPortfolio
Public facing repository of historical and learning assessments, outputs and artifacts. 
For now, simply presenting core competency, this will grow as I locate more from my annals and archives.
A good portion of my historical professional work has been on-behalf of corporate enterprises whom own the environments and work-products.
This is an initial effort at standing up a personal stand-alone environment.
